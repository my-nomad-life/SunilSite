Welcome to SunilSite! This is my personal website devoted to sharing my interests: piano, computer science (game dev, web dev, graphic design), chess, and cats.

Keep in mind that this is my first website EVER. It will have some bugs and over not look very polished, but that's OK to me. The main goal is to learn HTML and web dev as a whole, and make a fun website too.
